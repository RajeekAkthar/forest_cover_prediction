# Forest Cover Prediction

## Problem Statement

* Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.
* Task 2:-Create a predictive model which helps  to predict seven different cover types in four different wilderness areas of the Forest with the best accuracy.

## Dataset

The actual forest cover type for a given 30 x 30 meter cell was determined from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System data. Independent variables were then derived from data obtained from the US Geological Survey and USFS. The data is in raw form (not scaled) and contains binary columns of data for qualitative independent variables such as wilderness areas and soil type.
This study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances, so that existing forest cover types are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices.
The goal of the Project is to predict seven different cover types in four different wilderness areas of the Roosevelt National Forest of Northern Colorado with the best accuracy.
